	<h1>Pizza Falcon</h1>
	<p class="byline">Luke Acton, 2020</p>
	<p>
		Falcon rides upon a pillar of air and there<br>
		From his tower he sees this, his city.<br>
		All windows and wet buildings shim’ring fair<br>
		Now fresh with rain and colours pretty.<br>
		He falls downwards like a blazing stone<br>
		In the air and cool clouds alone<br>
		Falling for the day, falling to his prey.<br>
		The voice of the wind cries,<br>
  </p>

  <p>
		Fly! Hide!<br>
		Out of the clouds into the flock<br>
		He kills without the slightest squawk<br>
		Winged, terrible and bloody and beautiful<br>
		His eyes yellow and keen: immovable<br>
		Out of all their fears he is borne<br>
		He bears one of theirs away, torn.<br>
		Landing on the tip of a tree<br>
		He tears into the flesh but pauses and sees<br>
		This rat with this, his catch:<br>
		A triangular slice with circles to match.<br>
		What have you got there Mr Rat?<br>
		You’re talking to me?<br>
		I’m talking to you and I said what is that?<br>
		None of your business… but come and you’ll see.<br>
		Solely a shadow he flies to the rat<br>
		Picking at the pizza, he shows no grace<br>
		But the flavour is full, something to chase.<br>
		I want to have more.<br>
		But this slice is mine!<br>
		A flap of his wings and Rat is left sore.<br>

	<p>
		The hunger in its prime<br>
		The falcon – he is hushed and rushed –<br>
		Climbing, his mind clearer and pointing t’ward the sun<br>
		There’s work to be done!<br>
		A fresh prey in his eyes<br>
		Circles: yellow and red<br>
		Scorching the ground with his shadow, he fills the skies<br>
		Following the scent, pulling its thread<br>
		Soon finding the prime scene<br>
		For the true prize, it’s sheen<br>
		Dazzling from paper plates, to it he’s bound.<br>
		He scratches his form to the ground<br>
		Catching the blue<br>
		A speck in the skyline, a perfect view<br>
		He’s ready to crater<br>
		Pulling up at the last moment, no later<br>
		Blasting the diners, blinding you.<br>
		Snatching pizza from hands on cue.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		After, with laughter, he makes his escape.<br>
		Burdened with treasure, he hits at the air.<br>
		Beating the blue, trying to get to where?<br>
		The shouts, they rise, to him, to fear<br>
		Eyes, hands and grips, they all grow near.<br>
		Spinning escape through a gutter<br>
		He’s safe here in this slick sewage butter.<br>
		Creation in his claws, fine and divine<br>
		With plastic cheese, in his eyes: sublime<br>
		From they’re sockets, they’re blown wide and bright.<br>
		Fat, carbs and sauce fuelling his might.<br>
		Its form folding, enclosing his entire heart<br>
		This from baseness, a predator, apart.<br>
		Reaching now to his beak, before his mouth could speak.<br>

	<p>
		The light shines upon him. For five days he floats<br>
		He doesn’t want prey with feathers that coat<br>
		He wants pizza, a game that pays:<br>
		It earned his love, his faith, his gaze.<br>
		People now know his wicked dive<br>
		From them their pizza he deprives.<br>
		There isn’t a slice that escapes his taste,<br>
		Diners pick up, shouting loud in their haste:<br>
		It’s the Pizza Falcon.<br>
		Scheming<br>
		The pizza bosses gather ‘round their table<br>
		And begin the demise of the Pizza Falcon, dreaming<br>
		Of a trap as tight as they are able.<br>
		They set aside their generations’ strife<br>
		Combining their skills collected for life<br>
		Creating a pie that’s so good it gleams,<br>
		As none has ever seen:<br>
		So beautiful<br>
		It’s beyond taste. It’s musical.<br>
		One no-one could resist,<br>
		Not man nor beast, not fish nor fowl.<br>
		This falcon, he will forever persist:<br>
		Feeling his stomach growl<br>
		He will be driven beyond all wildness<br>
		Senses driven to the edge of blindness<br>
		Save for the pizza, the terrific force<br>
		That would draw, claw him and bring him before<br>
		The source of pizza pangs so big<br>
		The city is from its wits divorced.<br>
		The best ingredients and the hottest ovens<br>
		Cooking day and night there, chefs, more than a dozen<br>
		Until created is the best pizza the planet ever saw.<br>
		One that will not be seen more.<br>
	</p>

		It draws the falcon, everyone.<br>
		It rises t’wards the sun<br>
		Rises true from the highest block as a beacon<br>
		For miles and miles, it’s putting its curse on<br>
		And in them, there, exposed and unable to fight<br>
		The curse with all the muster and the might<br>
		Those chefs, those artists, those druids could throw,<br>
		Evil designs always in tow.<br>
		He flew as it crowned the town, there beaming.<br>
		Racing, racing, racing, screaming.<br>
		Feeling the wind’s knots and its twists<br>
		Grasping, groping, peeling his feathers and his wits.<br>
		50, 100, 200 miles, more<br>
		In a single hour<br>
		Straight for it, his heart’s score:<br>
		All its power.<br>
		A net carefully set<br>
		His dive complete – not yet<br>
		The dizzy, dreamy dance.<br>
		The hunters take their chance.<br>
		The falcon’s form lighting the oxygen<br>
		Around him, he blazes almost past them,<br>
		But deep into the ropes he falls<br>
		They’re bringing a bag to hide his calls<br>
		To the pizza, he’s close, reaching<br>
		Desperate. And from its perch it’s knocked spinning<br>
		The prize gone forever from eyes.<br>

		YOU!<br>
		Say his captors, this culinary crew<br>
		Do you know what you’ve done?<br>
		All of this from just one.<br>
		Our lives are now sans calm, sans all repute<br>
		From your flashes and feats<br>
		Can you dispute?<br>
		Now we’re taking you away from these streets.<br>
		A hood for his dark head, his feet shackled,<br>
		They take him down<br>
		To the dampest and the deepest<br>
		Hole in the city, far beneath the ground.<br>
		Dark and sleepless<br>
		Where life is small and sad and creeps<br>
		This is where they put him. He weeps.<br>
		Time settling like dew, it grows so cold<br>
		He feels a thought that grows like mould:<br>
		It would be best if all hope you did purge.<br>
		Between the dark the men emerge<br>
		With sticks and words. From both, he bleeds.<br>
		They place their pain to punish his greed.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		It pulls from him the purest action<br>
		In his limbs it coils tight, a plain reaction<br>
		His wings in a cage, canned<br>
		Escape is his mission, his flight’s at hand.<br>
		The men soon come red and drunken<br>
		Their eyes are full, dumb, they’re sunken<br>
		Stumbling around the room in glee and wine<br>
		Give him, he’s mine.<br>
		Out of his cage and to their hands<br>
		A better moment he couldn’t have planned.<br>
		All strength left pushed into his wings<br>
		Into his claws, clawing all things:<br>
		On hands, faces, eyes. His wings spann’d<br>
		Across the room. Across all land<br>
		And oceans soon<br>
		Out of this box, fleeing this room.<br>
		Down corridors, flying up flights<br>
		Up, draining his might<br>
		Almost doubting they stop<br>
		But stopping – daring not<br>
	</p>
	<img class="new" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5878c83e9c3c34ce352293d09cbe738d/99542228517e69b6-02/s540x810/a7e56ea66c79a580edd9814c39daebba6e263079.png">
	<p>
		Pouring from the windows, sunlight.<br>
		He can hear bellows behind him<br>
		There’s fuel for this, his flight:<br>
		Fear filling to the brim.<br>
		Racing, hopping, flapping for his freedom<br>
		The front door flies open<br>
		And he sees what he’s seen<br>
		When he’s dreaming his dreams<br>
		All creatures and colour<br>
		A joy and another<br>
		But there’s men in the door. With feathers fanned<br>
		Heading t’wards it, charging the band<br>
		Of men, to free himself, their prized plunder<br>
		The world he’s calling with eyes in wonder.<br>
		The men are armed, arms flying everywhere<br>
		The blows, they fill the air.<br>
		The rolling pin swinging, it hits his wing<br>
		Spinning through the door he’s singing<br>
		Racing to the pavement<br>
		Through a hole in the street he falls<br>
		Far but free and vagrant<br>
		The sewers infinite in their vanishing halls<br>
		Here, fear whispers: How to get out?<br>
		Follow this flow and banish all your doubt,<br>
		Whispers the underground river.<br>
		The men approach, I wouldn’t dither.<br>
		He stepped along, chasing the rain.<br>
		‘Till finally he saw the light again.<br>
		In the beams of moonlight, he flies<br>
		Without a mind that’s fit or wise<br>
		But pointed fiercely t’wards his want<br>
		His bones, feathers, his beak and eyes, they’re all<br>
		Players for his urges, which haunt<br>
		And always drives and always drives his fall<br>
		Into the air, all full from its promise<br>
		Of what? Freedom and everything.<br>
		His eyes and blood are honest<br>
		In men his screams are ringing.<br>
